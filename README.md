#pyDAN : TAKING DATA TO ALGORITHMS
==================================
##What is it?
----------------
The pyDAN is an ongoing to attempt to make the power of SQL analytics available to data scientists and statisticians and minimize dependence over SLQ engineer. The idea
is to use all the tools at disposal namely SQL, Python, Java and Cython in one single framework and provide user with an unprecendented ability to pull, clean
merge, munge and preanalyze data from multiple sources and stored across several platforms.

#How do we do it?
-------------------
The SQL standard a high level layer providing uniform (okay nearly uniform) interface to a large number of  the database management systems. We propose to put up and additional
layer (mostly in python) thus relieving user from creating SQL (or most of it) code himself.
